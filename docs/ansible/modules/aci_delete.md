# aci_delete

This module is used to compare the rendered configuration of a certain object with the currently configured objects within ACI. If an object is configured within ACI but missing from the rendered configuration it will be deleted subsequently. Some objects, like ones configured from MSO or objects with a name of "default" will be ignored (not considered for deletion). There are certain module options to define additional attributes/values which would indicate that the object should not be considered for deletion.
